# Bank Customer Churn â€” Clustering & Segmentation

This project applies **unsupervised learning techniques** (DBSCAN, PCA, and Silhouette Score) to segment bank customers based on demographic and financial features.  
The aim is to identify meaningful customer groups that can help the bank understand churn behavior and design better retention strategies.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
We use a bank customer churn dataset (commonly available from Kaggle/UCI).  
Key columns include:

- **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Geography  
- **Account info**: CreditScore, Balance, Tenure, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary  
- **Churn label**: Exited (1 = churned, 0 = retained) â€” *not used in clustering*
